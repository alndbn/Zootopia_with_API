#  Zootopia â€“ Animal Website Generator

This project generates a webpage (`animals.html`) based on real animal data fetched from the **API Ninjas Animals API**.  
Users can enter the name of an animal, and the program will display information such as:

- Name  
- Diet  
- Location  
- Other basic characteristics  

If no animal is found, a friendly error message will appear instead.
